JupyterLab only supports Python.

<choice id="1">

<opt text="True">
Remember that the Jupyter Project is created to be language agnostic? It supports multiple languages, including Python, Julia, R, and more.
</opt>

<opt text="False" correct="true">
</opt>

</choice>

Among the following options, which one is JupyterLab most similar to?

<choice id="2">

<opt text="Python">
JupyterLab is an IDE, whereas Python is a programming language.
</opt>

<opt text="Visual Studio Code" correct="true">
Both JupyterLab and Visual Studio code are IDEs with similar features.
</opt>

<opt text="GitHub">
JupyterLab is an IDE, whereas GitHub is an online platform for hosting and managing code through the Git system.

When you use the "Simple" mode in JupyterLab, all windows will be closed except for the currently active one.

<choice id="1">

<opt text="True">
All other windows will be just <b>hidden</b> from view, not closed! Once you disable the "Simple" mode, you'll see already open windows back in their original place.
</opt>

<opt text="False" correct="true">
</opt>

</choice>

All JupyterLab windows have the same toolbar.

<choice id="2">

<opt text="True">
As opposed to a notebook window, you'd see that a terminal window, for example, does not have a toolbar at all.

Suppose that you have just opened a notebook with the following cells:

<img src="/module7/mcq.png" width="500"></img>

What happens if you hit `Shift + Tab` while your cursor is in the shown position?

<choice id="1">

<opt text="A pop-up will appear to show the <code>pd.read_csv()</code>'s documentation">
This is what's expected to happen, but it won't. Remember that, you've just opened your notebook...
</opt>

<opt text="Nothing will appear" correct="true">
Since the first cell is not executed yet, the notebook's kernel doesn't know anything about those functions.
</opt>

<opt text="You'll get an error message">
No error error message will appear as a result of pressing <code>Shift + Tab</code>.
</opt>

<opt text="JupyterLab's contextual help window will be opened">
The <code>Shift + Tab</code> shortcut is not set for opening the contextual help window.
</opt>

</choice>

A notebook's console uses the same kernel as the notebook itself.

<choice id="2">

<opt text="True" correct="true">
</opt>

<opt text="False">
Even though you can launch an independent console in JupyterLab too, the console opened for a particular notebook is connected to the same kernel as the notebook.
</opt>

</choice>

We have a notebook like the following:

<img src="/module7/mcq2.png" width="500"></img>

What do you think the output will be if we run the last cell?

<choice id="3">

<opt text="27">
Note the order in which the cells have been executed. This would have been the output if only the second cell was already run.
</opt>

<opt text="9">
Note the order in which the cells have been executed. This would have been the output if the second and third cell were already run.
</opt>

<opt text="60" correct="true">
</opt>

<opt text="An error message">
Note that some cells have already been executed. An error message would have resulted from running the last cell only if the kernel didn't know about the variable <code>num</code>.

It's possible to run code inside Markdown code blocks if you've specified the language after the first three back ticks, e.g. ` ```python`.

<choice id="1">

<opt text="True">
You can't run code inside a Markdown document! Code can only be executed inside code cells in a Jupyter notebook.
</opt>

<opt text="False" correct="true">
</opt>

</choice>

Markdown documents can be rendered with any text editor.

<choice id="2">

<opt text="True">
You can <b>open</b> a Markdown document with any text editor, since it only contains plain text. However, you can view <b>rendered output</b> only in environments that support displaying Markdown output, such as JupyterLab, VS Code, and GitHub.
</opt>

<opt text="False" correct="true">

Which of the following statements is false?

<choice id="1">

<opt text="When you edit a notebook, all notebook views reflect the change.">
This is a true statement.
</opt>

<opt text="A notebook converted to Markdown format can be opened with any text editor.">
This is a true statement.
</opt>

<opt text="A source extension requires rebuilding JupyterLab.">
This is a true statement.
</opt>

<opt text="Different kernels can be used with different views of a notebook." correct="true">
Views are just "views". In other words, view are like looking at a single notebook, but from different viewpoints.
Each single notebook in Jupyter Lab can only be connected to a single kernel.
</opt>

</choice>

Which of the following prefix characters can be used in to run shell commands inside a code cell?

<choice id="2">

<opt text="<code>&</code>">
This is not a valid command prefix in for a notebook cell.
