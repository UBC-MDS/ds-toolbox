<exercise id='2' title="✍️ Practice: Keeping a notebook ">

Suppose that you have just opened a notebook with the following cells:

<img src="/module7/mcq.png" width="500"></img>

What happens if you hit `Shift + Tab` while your cursor is in the shown position?

<choice id="1">

<opt text="A pop-up will appear to show the <code>pd.read_csv()</code>'s documentation">
This is what's expected to happen, but it won't. Remember that, you've just opened your notebook...
</opt>

<opt text="Nothing will appear" correct="true">
Since the first cell is not executed yet, the notebook's kernel doesn't know anything about those functions. The missing counter on the left indicates that a cell is not executed, but watch out, you might open up a notebook that has a numbered cell from a previous execution which might make you think that you have executed it in this session yourself.
</opt>

<opt text="You'll get an error message">
No error error message will appear as a result of pressing <code>Shift + Tab</code>.
</opt>

<opt text="JupyterLab's contextual help window will be opened">
The <code>Shift + Tab</code> shortcut is not set for opening the contextual help window.
</opt>

</choice>

**True or False**

A notebook's console uses the same kernel as the notebook itself.

<choice id="2">

<opt text="True" correct="true">
</opt>

<opt text="False">
Even though you can launch an independent console in JupyterLab too, the console opened for a particular notebook is connected to the same kernel as the notebook.
</opt>

</choice>

We have a notebook like the following:

<img src="/module7/mcq2.png" width="500"></img>

What do you think the output will be if we run the last cell?

<choice id="3">

<opt text="27">
Note the order in which the cells have been executed. This would have been the output if only the second cell was already run.
</opt>

<opt text="9">
Note the order in which the cells have been executed. This would have been the output if the second and third cell were already run.
</opt>

<opt text="60" correct="true">
</opt>

<opt text="An error message">
Note that some cells have already been executed. An error message would have resulted from running the last cell only if the kernel didn't know about the variable <code>num</code>.
</opt>

<exercise id='4' title="✍️ Practice: Markdown is everywhere we look">

**True or False**

It's possible to run code inside Markdown code blocks if you've specified the language after the first three back ticks, e.g. `python`.

<choice id="1">

<opt text="True">
You can't run code inside a Markdown document! Code can only be executed inside code cells in a Jupyter notebook.
</opt>

<opt text="False" correct="true">
</opt>

</choice>

**True or False**

Markdown documents can be rendered with any text editor.

<choice id="2">

<opt text="True">
You can <b>open</b> a Markdown document with any text editor, since it only contains plain text. However, you can view <b>rendered output</b> only in environments that support displaying Markdown output, such as JupyterLab, VS Code, and GitHub.
</opt>

<opt text="False" correct="true">

Which of the following statements is false?

<choice id="1">

<opt text="When you edit a notebook, all notebook views reflect the change.">
This is a true statement.
</opt>

<opt text="A notebook converted to Markdown format can be opened with any text editor.">
This is a true statement.
</opt>

<opt text="A source extension requires rebuilding JupyterLab.">
This is a true statement.
</opt>

<opt text="Different kernels can be used with different views of a notebook." correct="true">
Views are just "views". In other words, view are like looking at a single notebook, but from different viewpoints.
Each single notebook in Jupyter Lab can only be connected to a single kernel.
</opt>

</choice>

Which of the following statements is true?

<choice id="2">

<opt text="You should avoid using extensions since they are a security risk">
Although some extension could provide security risks since they are written by someone else, they are not more dangerous than downloading a Python package made by someone else. In other words, most popular extensions are safe and you are encouraged to use them to improve your JupyterLab experience.
</opt>

<opt text="Prebuilt extensions can be installed via the extension manager GUI">
This is only true for the old source extension format.
</opt>

<opt text="Exporting to WebPDF requires that you install the LaTeX typesetting program">
This is only required for the regular PDF export.
</opt>

<opt text="Additional cell and notebook views are helpful when working with long notebook files" correct="true">
Using additional views can allow you to compare output and input cells next to each other, even if they are far apart in the notebook.
