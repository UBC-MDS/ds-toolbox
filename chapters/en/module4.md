Clone the repo https://github.com/UBC-MDS/equine_numbers_value_canada. What is the hash or the first commit of the project?

<choice id="1">
<opt text='cc400df4b2a382f653abd0d9e514f6daae98d2ad'>
Is the first commit of the project or the first commit of the user flor14?
</opt>
<opt text='e98d2ad'>
To use a shorter version of a commit hash you should select the first characters, not the last ones.
</opt>
<opt text='cc400df'>
Is the first commit of the project or the first commit of the user flor14?
</opt>
<opt text='0896801'>
This is correct, but there is one more correct answer.
</opt>
<opt text='0896801fdd38d461414e0b061b2b2ef3395f7dd0'>
This is correct, but there is one more correct answer.

Is the first commit of the project or the first commit of the user flor14?

What kind of information is not displayed **not** in a Git project's history?

<opt text='HASH'>

When checking your project history you will see that the commits are displayed from older to newer using the date as a reference, but there is no explicit commit enumeration.

View this <code>git diff</code> comparison between on GitHub:
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/equine_numbers_value_canada/compare/1bb5ab8..9021b83

You can see that there has been changes made to the `README.md` file,
highlighted in red and green in the web interface.
Looking at the commit history of the repository and the order the commits were made in,
which of the red and green highlights represent
the current state of the <code>README.md</code> file in the repository?

<choice id="3">
<opt text='Red'>
The colors could be tricky, because they depend on in which order the commits are written, so you can't rely on the same color always indicating that a change is newer/older. Try reversing the order of the commits to `1bb5ab8..9021b83` and you will see.
</opt>
<opt text='Green' correct='true'>
If you go to the current state of the repository (https://github.com/UBC-MDS/equine_numbers_value_canada/) and check the <code>README.md</code> file or the commit history,
you can see that the green highlights represent the more recent commits
(remember that the color alone is not enough to tell which are more recent,
try reversing the order of the commits to `1bb5ab8..9021b83` and you will see.).
</opt>
</choice>

How could you make this same comparison using `git diff` from the command line https://github.com/UBC-MDS/equine_numbers_value_canada/compare/1bb5ab8..9021b83?

<choice id="4">
<opt text='<code>git diff 9021b83</code>' >
<code>9021b83</code> is the hash of the last commit, what would you like to compare it with?
</opt>
<opt text='<code>git diff 1bb5ab8</code>' >
That's right, but there is also another correct option!
</opt>
<opt text='<code>git diff 1bb5ab8 9021b83</code>' >
That's right, but there is also another correct option!
</opt>
<opt text='The first and third options are both correct' >
In the first option, <code>9021b83</code> is the hash of the last commit, what would you like to compare it with?
</opt>
<opt text='The second and third option are both correct' correct='true' >
Writing the newest commit is not necessary. If you write only one commit (that is not the newest one) it will compare it with the last one without specifying anything else.

**True or False**

Select all the situations in which it is a good idea to reset your work to a previous commit:

<choice>
<opt text='When you are working on a project locally, without having already pushed your work to the remote' correct='true'>

If you are working locally on a private project, it is quite safe to use reset. Nobody is going to be affected by you deleting part of the history of your project.

</opt>
<opt text='When we are working with other collaborators pushing to the same repository' >

This is not a good idea, because you are deleting part of the history of your project. Keep in mind that your collaborators are working with the full history. This could pose a problem at the time of combining the information. In this case, it is probably better to revert the changes—a command that we are going to learn in the next sections of this module.

</opt>

<opt text='Both are correct' >

You can hard-reset your work in both cases, but one of the options could cause problems.

</opt>

<exercise id='8' title='✍️ Practice: Subtraction through addition (of a new commit)'>

Which of the following statements are TRUE about `git revert`?

<choice id="1">
<opt text='This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes from previous commits.' >
</opt>
That's right, but there is also another correct option!
<opt text='This command undoes the changes in your project up to the commit hash that you have specified.'>
That's right, but there is also another correct option!
</opt>
<opt text='This command makes the history of the project shorter by deleting commits'>
Resetting deletes commits, but reverting does not.
</opt>
<opt text='This command is used to undo changes in your working directory that have not been comitted yet.'>
We cannot use revert for this task.
</opt>
<opt text='The first and second options are both correct' correct='true'>
</opt>
<opt text='The first and third options are both correct'>
Is the third options really correct?
</opt>
</choice>

You are writing a book using version control and you have a text file for each chapter in your local repository. Today, after reading your work again, you decided to move some of the text you have written for `chapter3.md` to `chapter1.md`. How would you save this change using Git?

<choice id="2">
<opt text='I would cut and copy the text into a new file, add both files to the staging area, and then commit with a message explaining the changes.' correct='true'>

</opt>

<opt text='I would <b>revert</b> to the commit I did after writing that paragraph. Then, I would add the text in the correct chapter and make a new commit with a message explaining the changes.'>

Are you sure you want to lose all the changes you made in `chapter2.md`? Even if you can recover those changes, reverting the changes will make you go back to that particular point in the the history of your project.

</opt>

<opt text='I would perform a <b>hard reset</b> to the commit I did after writing that paragraph. Then, I would add the text in the correct chapter and make a new commit with a message explaining the changes.'>

When you do a hard reset, you are deleting the history of your project up to a particular commit. This means that you will lose all the changes you made between that particular commit and your most recent one.

<opt text='Accept incoming change'>

<exercise id='12' title='✍️ Practice: Ignorance is bliss'>

**True or False**

`**/` is prepended to an entry in `.gitignore` to tell Git that this entry is a folder.

<choice id="1">

<opt text="True">
<code>**/</code> is used to tell Git that the same file/folder name should be ignored in the subdirectories of a repo as well.
</opt>

<opt text="False"  correct="true">
</opt>

</choice>

The `.gitignore` file itself can be committed and pushed to a remote repository.

<choice id="2">

<opt text="True" correct="true">
Yes, <code>.gitignore</code> is like any other file in your repository, so if you want to share it with your collaborators, you need to commit it and push it to the remote repository.
</opt>

<opt text="False">
<code>.gitignore</code> is like any other file in your repository, so if you want to share it with your collaborators, you need to commit it and push it to the remote repository.
