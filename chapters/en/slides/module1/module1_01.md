# Introduction to the Data Science Toolbox

Notes:
In this slide deck
we will introduce the data science tools
we are covering in this course.

We will briefly indicate the purpose of each tool
so that you have an idea
of what they are for
before we will dive into how to install and use them.

<!--TODO add a logo on the slide for each  tool -->

## The Shell (Bash)

 <!-- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odb/official-bash-logo/master/assets/Logos/Icons/PNG/512x512.png -->

- Navigate the filesystem
- Launch programs
- Automation of tasks

Notes:
A shell is a tool that we can use to
navigate our computers file system,
launch programs,
and automate tasks.

You can think of it as similar, but more powerful,
than the default file browser on your computer.
The specific shell that we will learn more about in this course
is called Bash.

## Git and GitHub

    <div class="column">
        <img src="https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Icon-1788C.png" alt="Git logo" width="200px"></img>
        <ul>
        <li>Version control</li>
        <li>Collaboration</li>
        <li>Communication</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" alt="GitHub logo" width="200px"></img>
    </div>
</div>


Notes:
Git is a program that runs on your computer
and allows you to keep track of old versions of your files.
This version control is similar to how "Track Changes" works
in word processors,
but much more powerful.

GitHub is an online platform
where developers and data scientists
can collaborate on their projects
by raising issues, discuss features,
and review code.

## JupyterLab and VS Code

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        <img src="https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/main-logo.svg" alt="Jupyter Logo" width="200px"></img>
        <ul>
        <li>Edit text and code files</li>
        <li>Develop interactive notebooks</li>
        <li>Create and view data visualizations</li>
        <li>Generate reports</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/images/code-stable.png" alt="VS Code Logo" width="200px"></img>
    </div>
</div>

Notes:
You are already familiar with JupyterLab
from the Programming with Python course,
where we used it to edit our Jupyter notebooks.
Notebooks are powerful since they allow us to combine
code, text, and rich output such as data visualizations.

In this course we will see some more advanced features of JupyterLab
and also introduce you to another commonly used tool for programming:
VS Code.
VS Code is a more traditional programming environment than JupyterLab
and we will explore the reasons for using one over the other
later in this module.

## Jupyter Book and Markdown

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/aedee257645ee41906c4d64f66f71b7f0dc7acfa/docs/images/logo-square.svg" alt="Jupyter Logo" width="200px"></img>
        <ul>
        <li>Create websites, books, and documentation</li>
        <li>Allows for code execution and interaction</li>
        <li>Content is written in Jupyter Notebooks and text files</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcurtis/markdown-mark/983259b19bbc9673e9cf337b98ac899bf8a1484a/svg/markdown-mark-solid.svg" alt="VS Code Logo" width="200px"></img>
    </div>
</div>


Notes:
Jupyter Book is an open source project for building beautiful,
publication-quality books and documents.
The books allow for code to be executed
and for visualizations to be interacted with.

Content is written in Jupyter Notebooks and text files,
using Markdown syntax.
You have already seen some simple examples of using Markdown
for text formatting
and this extends that syntax to involve more advanced features
which are helpful when authoring a book or web page.

## Conda

<img src="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/_images/conda_logo.svg" alt="Conda logo" width="400px"></img>

- Installing programs and packages (Python, R, and more)
- Managing software versions
- Separating software that requires different environments

Notes:
Conda is a package manager,
which provides a convenient way to install programs and packages.
It allows us to keep different programs separate,
so that there are not conflicts
when two programs requires different versions
of the same software.

## A commitment to open source

<img src="https://opensource.org/files/osi_standard_logo_0.png" alt="Open Source Initiative logo" width="200px"></img>


- Being able to use the software after leaving school without paying exorbitant amounts of money
- Having access to the source code - you can learn and fix bugs
  (even closed source, Commercial Software has bugs, they are just harder to see and help fixing...).
- Open Source software is customizable and flexible
- It's becoming the standard in many tech companies
- You are part of an awesome and active community!

Notes:
All the programs mentioned in the previous slides
have active development communities and are open source,
which means that anyone can read the source code and contribute to these projects.
Open source programs have many benefits,
such as those mentioned on this slide.
