# Module Learning Outcomes

In this module students will learn how to

- Explain the importance of data visualizations.
- Use Altair's grammar of graphics.
- Create point and line visualizations in Altair.
- Transform data directly in Altair instead of pandas.
- Combine graphical marks via layering.


1. Introduction to computing and text-based communication
    - [521 intro to computing section](https://pages.github.ubc.ca/mds-2021-22/DSCI_521_platforms-dsci_students/materials/lectures/1-lecture1-MDStools-shell-git-github.html#introduction-to-computing)
2. Introduction to the toolbox, give an overview of what each tool does and where it fits in the toolchain
3. [Installing things](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/installation_instructions/)
    - We could either give this as part of lab0 only, or show how to do some of it during lecture as well.
    - [Simpler installation version in dsci100 textbook](https://datasciencebook.ca/move-to-your-own-machine.html)
4. Intro to VS Code
    - I think this makes sense because it lets us use vscode for markdown documents, merge conflicts, and graphical git views in the following chapters. It can also be used to open files from terminal via `code <filename>`, which jupyterlab can't.
        - I am hesitant to fully teach the graphical git interface from vscode and jupyterlab, but we can discuss it.
5. Create minimal reproducible code examples when asking for help.
    - [Lec8 521 first half](https://pages.github.ubc.ca/mds-2021-22/DSCI_521_platforms-dsci_students/materials/lectures/8-asking-effectively-and-virtual-environments.html)
