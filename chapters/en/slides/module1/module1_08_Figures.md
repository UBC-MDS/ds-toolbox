# Figures

Notes: To show an example of how plots are rendered, we will use the seaborn plotting package which is a high level interface to the more widely known matplotlib package.
This is just to illustrate how plots show up in the notebook rather than a tutorial on how to plot in Python so I will not go into details on what these commands mean.

# Exporting notebooks

The combination of code, plots, and markdown is powerful. With these three elements, you can keep all your analysis code and interpretations in the same document, instead of spread across different files.
Notebooks are excellent tools to build entire reports, since they can contain formatting such as a table of contents, links to sections and files, footnotes, images, bibliographies, and even videos, which we will learn more about later in the workshop.
You can export the notebook to different file types via File --> Export Notebook As....
When you export to PDF for the first time on your own machine, you might be asked to download the Latex packages, which are needed to create the PDF.
Notes: An alternative to exporting to PDF via latex is to use the WebPDF option which makes the exported PDF have a more similar style to how the notebook looks in JupyterLab.
If we would export this notebook to HTML, we would still retain the interactivity of the plots we created!
