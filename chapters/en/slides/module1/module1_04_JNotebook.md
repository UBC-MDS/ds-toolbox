# Juyter Notebook

Notes: We're greeted by the launcher tab where we see that we can start either a Notebook or Console for Python or R, as well as some other utility programs.

# Juyter Notebook

Notes:So instead of the traditional IDE experience where you would write code in a text file and then have figures pop up in a different panel, this information now all resides in the same document, which facilitates reproducibility and collaboration.
The Notebooks can be exported to many formats, including PDF and HTML, which makes it easy to share your project with anyone.
