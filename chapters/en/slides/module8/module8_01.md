## What is Jupyter Book?

<br>

<img src="/module8/jb_logo.png" width="400"></img>

<br>

Key Jupyter Book features:

- Write publication-quality content
- Write content in multiple formats
- Add interactivity to your book
- Generate a variety of outputs
- A command-line interface

Notes:

Jupyter Book is an open source project to help you create publication-quality books and documents from Markdown documents and Jupyter Notebooks.

<br>

Key Jupyter Book features:

- Write publication-quality content including figures, math, citations and cross-references
- Write content as Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown, or reStructuredText
- Add interactivity to your book, e.g., toggle visibility of cells, connect with an online service like Binder, and include interactive outputs (e.g., figures and widgets)
- Generate a variety of outputs, including websites (HTML, CSS, JS), markdown and PDF.
- A command-line interface to quickly build books, e.g., `jupyter-book build mybook/`

## Book building process

<br>

Building a Jupyter Book broadly consists of these steps:

<br>

- ✏️ **Create your book’s content**

<br>

- 🛠 **Build your book**

<br>

- 📚 **Publish your book online**

Notes:

Building a Jupyter Book broadly consists of these steps:

- ✏️ **Create your book’s content.**
  - You structure your book with a collection of folders, files, and configuration.

- 🛠 **Build your book.**
  - Using Jupyter Book’s command-line interface you can convert your pages into either an HTML or a PDF book.

- 📚 **Publish your book online.**
  - Once your book is built, you can share it with others. Most common is to build HTML, and host it as a public website.

## How to quickly generate a sample book

You can create a sample book by running the following command:

```
jupyter-book create mynewbook/
```

<br>

The created directory `mynewbook/` should look like this:

```
mynewbook/
├── _config.yml
├── _toc.yml
├── intro.md
├── logo.png
├── markdown-notebooks.md
├── markdown.md
├── notebooks.ipynb
├── references.bib
└── requirements.txt
```

You can explore the configuration of the book in `_config.yml` and its structure in `_toc.yml`.

Notes:

Jupyter Book comes bundled with a lightweight sample book to help you understand a book’s structure.

You can create a sample book by running the following command:

```
jupyter-book create mynewbook/
```

This will generate a mini Jupyter Book in your current working directory that you can both build and explore locally.

The created directory `mynewbook/` should look like this:

```
mynewbook/
├── _config.yml
├── _toc.yml
├── intro.md
├── logo.png
├── markdown-notebooks.md
├── markdown.md
├── notebooks.ipynb
├── references.bib
└── requirements.txt
```

It will have a few decisions made for you, and you can explore the configuration of the book in `_config.yml` and its structure in `_toc.yml`.

We will use this sample Jupyter Book as a starting point to work from.

## Anatomy of a Jupyter Book

<br>

There are three things that you need in order to build a Jupyter Book, each of which was just created by running `jupyter-book create`:

- A configuration file (`_config.yml`)

- A table of contents file (`_toc.yml`)

- Your book’s content

Notes:

There are three things that you need in order to build a Jupyter Book, each of which was just created by running `jupyter-book create`:

- A configuration file (`_config.yml`)

- A table of contents file (`_toc.yml`)

- Your book’s content

<br>

There are a few extra files in there included to demonstrate some features, but the required pieces are `_toc.yml`, `_config.yml`, and content files.

We’ll cover each briefly in the next slides.

---

## Book configuration (`_config.yml`)

<br>

All of the configuration for your book is in a YAML file called `_config.yml`.

<br>

Here’s an example of a simple `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
# In _config.yml
title: My sample book
author: The Jupyter Book Community
logo: logo.png
execute:
  execute_notebooks: force

# Add a bibtex file so that we can create citations
bibtex_bibfiles:
  - references.bib
```

Notes:

All of the configuration for your book is in a YAML file called `_config.yml`.

You can define metadata for your book (such as its title), add a book logo, turn on different “interactive” buttons (such as a Binder button for pages built from a Jupyter Notebook), and more.

Here’s an example of a simple `_config.yml` file:

- `title`: defines a title for the book. It will show up in the left sidebar.

- `author`: adds the author’s name to your book template, for attribution.

- `logo`: defines a path to an image file for your book’s logo (it will also show up in the sidebar).

- `execute`: contains a collection of configuration options to control execution and cacheing.

- `execute_notebooks`: "force" tells Jupyter Book force execute any computational content each time it builds the book. By default, Jupyter Book executes and caches all book content.

- `bibtex_bibfiles`: is a section to define bibliography files for your Jupyter Book. This configuration activates citations for your book.

---

## Table of contents (`_toc.yml`)

<br>

Jupyter Book uses your **table of contents** file to define the structure of your book. For example, your chapters, sub-chapters, etc.

This is a YAML file with a collection of pages, each one linking to a file in your book:

```yaml
# In _toc.yml
format: jb-book
root: intro
chapters:
- file: markdown
- file: notebooks
- file: markdown-notebooks
```

<br>

**Important:**

Each entry under `chapters:` relates to a file, and they should be added as filenames with

- **no extensions** and

- **relative to your book’s root folder**.

Notes:

Jupyter Book uses your **table of contents** file to define the structure of your book. For example, your chapters, sub-chapters, etc.

This is a YAML file with a collection of pages, each one linking to a file in your book. Here’s an example of the two content files shown above:

```yaml
# In _toc.yml
format: jb-book
root: intro
chapters:
- file: markdown
- file: notebooks
- file: markdown-notebooks
```

The `_toc.yml` is arranged with a format such as `jb-article`, or `jb-book`.

The `root` item is considered the landing page (for `html` builds) and is used as front matter (for `latex` builds).

For `jb-book`, subsequent chapters can be added under the `chapters:` section in the `.yml` file.

<br>

**Important:** Each entry relates to a file, and they should be added as names with

- **no extensions** and

- **relative to your book’s root folder**.

The title of each chapter will be inferred from the title in your files, i.e. the top-level header specified with a single `#`, such as `# Title`.

---

## Table of contents (`_toc.yml`)

<br>

You can also put chapters into different groups, which are called `parts:`

<img src="/module8/parts.png" width="750"></img>

Notes:

You may optionally organize your chapters into parts, by using the `parts:` key in your `_toc.yml`:

The `parts:` key accepts a list of entries, each of which defines a chapter.

---

## Book content

<br>

**Markdown files (`.md`)**:

Markdown is an example of a markup language - a way to structure text with extra characters and syntax that give it extra meaning (e.g., using `**bold**` to denote **bold**).

<br>

Let’s take a look at one of the markdown files in the template book, `intro.md`:

<img src="/module8/markdown.png" width="600"></img>

Notes:

**Markdown files (`.md`)**:

Markdown is an example of a markup language - a way to structure text with extra characters and syntax that give it extra meaning (e.g., using `**bold**` to denote **bold**). It is very popular and used across many different technology platforms.

## Book content

<br>

**Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)**:

<img style="border:1px solid black;" src="/module8/jnotebook.png" width="500"></img>

Notes:

**Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)**:

The other type of content is a **Jupyter Notebook**, ending in `.ipynb`.

Jupyter Notebooks have a combination of **computational** content and **narrative** content.

Each notebook is associated with a kernel (e.g. Python, R, Julia) that defines the language used to execute the notebook’s computational content.

By default, when Jupyter Book builds your book, **notebooks will be executed and their outputs cached**. On subsequent builds, notebook pages will be re-executed only if their code has changed.

Any outputs generated by the notebook will be inserted into your built book (though they may not be in your input notebook). This way you do not need to store the notebook’s outputs with your repository.

---

## Time to build your book!

Since we have already created the sample book in the folder `mybookname/`, you can run the following `build` command to create a website:

```
jupyter-book build mybookname/
```

**Note**: You can use `jb` instead of `jupyter-book`, i.e., `jb build mybookname/`.

<br>

If you look into `mybookname/_build/html/` folder, you'll see something like this:

```
html/
├── _panels_static
│   ├── ...
├── _sources
│   ├── intro.md
│   ├── markdown-notebooks.ipynb
│   ├── ...
├── _static
│   ├── ...
├── index.html
...
```

Notes:

Now that we’ve added content and configured our book, it’s time to build outputs for your book.

Since we have already created the sample book in the folder `mybookname/`, you can simply run the following `build` command in your terminal to create a fully functioning HTML website:

```
jupyter-book build mybookname/
```

**Note**: You can use the short-hand `jb` instead of `jupyter-book` in the above command, i.e. `jb build mybookname/`.

<br>

If you look into `mybookname/_build/html/` folder, you'll see something like this:

```
html/
├── _panels_static
│   ├── ...
├── _sources
│   ├── intro.md
│   ├── markdown-notebooks.ipynb
│   ├── ...
├── _static
│   ├── ...
├── index.html
...
```

These are the files for a standalone website!

## Your first Jupyter Book website

<br>

This is what your home page file `_build/html/index.html` looks like:

<img style="border:1px solid black;" src="/module8/jb_index.png" width="800"></img>

Notes:

You can view the website you just created by opening `_build/html/index.html` using any browser that you like. You should see a webpage like this:

<img style="border:1px solid black;" src="/module8/jb_index.png" width="800"></img>
