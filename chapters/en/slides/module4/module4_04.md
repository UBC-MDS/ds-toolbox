# Revert your changes


1. **Doing a hard reset** ‚úîÔ∏è  
<br>

2. **Reverting previous changes** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è

Notes: 

We have already learned how to undo changes and 
delete our project history with **`git reset --hard`**.
But what if we want to keep track of the reversion? 


There is another way to go back in time,
and that is to **revert** your changes.

##  Revert your changes: Go back to a previous commit (JupyterLab)


<center>

<img src='/module4/vc-revert.png' width="80%" alt="404 image"/>

</center>

Notes:

If you want to revert your changes, 
go to JupyterLab's "History" tab and
click the arrow icon 
in the commit you want to go back to.

You do not lose the project's history 
when you revert changes.
Essentially,
you create a new commit 
that saves the information that 
some intermediate commits 
have been reverted.

## Revert your changes: move to a previous commit (JupyterLab)


<center>

<img src='/module4/vc-revert-2.png' width="80%" alt="404 image"/>

</center>

Notes:

When you click the arrow, 
JupyterLab will ask you for 
the commit title and description 
for that reversion. 
You can either keep the preloaded name here or
change it to something more meaningful.

## Revert your changes: move to a previous commit (JupyterLab)


<center>

<img src='/module4/vc-revert-3.png' width="80%" alt="404 image"/>

</center>

Notes:

Now you can see that you have a new commit,
and your project has gone back in time! 
Remember to push your changes 
if you want to keep your remote updated. 
This is especially important 
if you are working with other collaborators
who might be modifying the part that has been deleted!

## Revert your changes: move to a previous commit (terminal)

`git revert <commit id>`

<center>

<img src='/module4/vc-revert-t.png' width="80%" alt="404 image"/>

</center>

Notes:

If you want to do this with the terminal 
you will have to provide the commit id to identify the commit.

## Revert your changes: move to a previous commit (terminal)


<center>

<img src='/module4/vc-revert-t2.png' width="80%" alt="404 image"/>

</center>

Notes:

After running the command,
the editor will appear so
you can modify the final commit message.
If you close it as it is,
the message will be the default one.
You will see that after closing the editor,
now you have a new commit updated with the changes.

## Travelling back in time üïë

1. **Doing a hard reset** ‚úîÔ∏è  

<br>

2. **Reverting previous changes** ‚úîÔ∏è  

Notes: 

We have learned two methods
to go back in time in our project history:
hard reset and revert. 

One of the major differences is
that when we choose to do a hard reset
we are deleting the history of a project. 
This is the opposite of what happens
when you revert your changes. 
If you revert the changes 
you can include the deletions
as a new commit that grows 
the history of your project.

The question will be,
would you like to track the deletion (revert)
or go back to a previous point 
of your project (hard reset)?
