# What is .gitignore?

Notes:
In this slide deck we will learn how we can tell Git to exclude certain files from its version control.

## Unnecessary untracked files

You may have encountered this before:

```
git status
```

```out
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.ipynb_checkpoints/
	.DS_Store

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Notes:
As we know,
Git is letting us know about untracked files
(ones we have never committed before).
In the example on this slide,
the untracked files are two folders that are automatically saved:

- `.ipynb_checkpoints` contain old backup versions of our notebook which are saved by JupyterLab automatically.
- `.DS_Store` contains directory display options for the Finder application on MacOS.

The fact that they both start with a `.` means that they will be hidden in file browsers and in the output from `ls` in the terminal;
an indication that they are not something that we need to work with manually,
but are there for applications on our computer to use when needed.

Therefore,
we also don't care about making these folders part of our version controlled project
and weâ€™d prefer not to have them clutter our view of the `git status` output,
so that we instead can focus on the files we do want to track.
How can we achieve this?

## Create a `.gitignore` file

<br>

Use a text editor of your choice (here we use VS Code) to create a file called `.gitignore` inside your Git repo:

```
code .gitignore
```

<br>
Inside the text file, list the files and folders you would like to ignore, one per line. For example:

```
.ipynb_checkpoints/
.DS_Store
```

<br>
Save the file, add it to the staging area, and commit the changes with Git. Then try git status again. You should now see that the files are ignored by Git:

```
git status
```

```out
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Notes:
To "hide" folders and files from Git
we can create a file called `.gitignore` in the root/main directory of our repository
(the same directory where the `.git` folder is located).
This slide describes how we can create this file using VS Code,
and what we need to add to it
in order to ignore the two files from the previous slide.

## .gitignore tips and tricks

<br>

Here are two useful tricks so that you can avoid doing unnecessary work when it comes to `.gitignore`:

<br>

1. Recursively ignoring filename patterns

2. Using `.gitignore_global` to ignore certain patterns in every repository

Notes:
While we could list out every file we want to ignore
in every project's `.gitignore`,
this can quickly become tedious to type.

Instead,
we can use filename pattern matching and global Git settings
to simplify this process.
We will look closer at each of these two approach in the next couple of slides.

---

## 1. Recursively ignoring of filename patters

<br>

Wildcards can be used inside `.gitignore` to ignore multiple files with the same name:

```
*.log
```

Prepending `**/` to filenames ignores those files in subdirectories as well:

```
**/.*log
```

Starting with a `!` tells git to not ignore a certain directory.

```
**/*.log
!important/.*log
```

Notes:
The `.gitignore` file accepts wildcards for matching pattern names,
similar to what we learned about for the shell in Module 2.
So say that we e.g. have a Git repository
where a lot of log files files are created
and they all end in `.log`.
Instead of typing out the name of each file,
we could add `*.log` to the `.gitignore` file
and it would ignore all the log files in the root of the repository.

If we wanted to ignore the log files in every subdirectory of the project,
we would need to use the `**/` patterns,
which means "in any folder".
The line in our `.gitignore` would now read `**/*.log`.

What if we wanted to ignore all the log files,
except those inside a specific directory?
Let's imagine the directory of the log files we want to keep is called important.
We would now need to add two lines to our `.gitignore`:
one to ignore all log files,
and a second to tell git to not ignore the log files in the important directory.
It would look like this:

```
**/*.log
!important/.*log
```

## 2. Using `.gitignore_global`

<br>

Create a global `.gitignore` file so that you do not have to create the same `.gitignore` for all your repos

<br>

Here are the steps to follow:

- Use a text editor to create a file called `.gitignore_global`. You can run `code ~/.gitignore_global` in a terminal to do this.

- Just like for a regular `.gitignore` file, add a list of files and folders that you want to get ignored in **all** repos on your computer

- Save `.gitignore_global`

Notes:
Now comes the second trick: There might be certain files that you'd like to always get ignored in all repos. In that case, you can add them once to a global `.gitignore` file called `.gitignore_global` which lives in your home directory.

This way, you'll no longer need to add those particular file or folder names to the `.gitignore` file of each repo on your computer!
