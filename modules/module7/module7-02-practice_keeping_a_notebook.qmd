# 1.1. Exercises

## ✍️ Practice: Keeping a notebook

Suppose that you have just opened a notebook with the following cells:

![](../../static/module7/mcq.png){width="60%" fig-alt="404 image"}

<div id='mcq1'></div>
<script>
    generateQuiz(
        'mcq1',
        'Question 1',
        'What happens if you hit <code>Shift + Tab</code> while your cursor is in the shown position?',
        {
        'A pop-up will appear to show the <code>pd.read_csv()</code>’s documentation': 'This is what’s expected to happen, but it won’t. Remember that, you’ve just opened your notebook...',
        'Nothing will appear': 'Since the first cell is not executed yet, the notebook’s kernel doesn’t know anything about those functions. The missing counter on the left indicates that a cell is not executed, but watch out, you might open up a notebook that has a numbered cell from a previous execution which might make you think that you have executed it in this session yourself.',
        'You’ll get an error message': 'No error error message will appear as a result of pressing <code>Shift + Tab</code>.',
        'JupyterLab’s contextual help window will be opened': 'The <code>Shift + Tab</code> shortcut is not set for opening the contextual help window.',
        },
        'Nothing will appear',
    );
</script>

<div id='mcq2'></div>
<script>
    generateQuiz(
        'mcq2',
        'True or False',
        'A notebook’s console uses the same kernel as the notebook itself.',
        {
        'True': '',
        'False': 'Even though you can launch an independent console in JupyterLab too, the console opened for a particular notebook is connected to the same kernel as the notebook.',
        },
        'True',
    );
</script>

We have a notebook like the following:

![](../../static/module7/mcq2.png){width="50%" fig-alt="404 image"}

<div id='mcq3'></div>
<script>
    generateQuiz(
        'mcq3',
        'Question 3',
        'What do you think the output will be if we run the last cell?',
        {
        '27': 'Note the order in which the cells have been executed. This would have been the output if only the second cell was already run.',
        '9': 'Note the order in which the cells have been executed. This would have been the output if the second and third cell were already run.',
        '60': '',
        'An error message': 'Note that some cells have already been executed. An error message would have resulted from running the last cell only if the kernel didn’t know about the variable <code>num</code>.',
        },
        '60',
    );
</script>
