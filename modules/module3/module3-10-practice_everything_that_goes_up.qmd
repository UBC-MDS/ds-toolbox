<div id='mcq1'></div>

    generateQuiz(
        'mcq1',
        'Question 1',
        'When working on a project that is under version control, how often should you <code>push</code> to your online GitHub repository?',
        {
        'Obsessively, like every 5 minutes': 'You will probably be better using your time to move forward with the project than pushing this frequently.',
        'At least at the end of every session you work on the project': 'This is a minimum. You can push more often if you have important updates to share your colleagues or want more frequent backups of your repository.',
        '2-3 times': 'What if you have done more (or less) important changes to your project than 2-3?',
        'Only once, shortly before the deadline': 'If you are working in a collaborative project, pushing too close to a deadline could reveal merging conflicts that would take time to solve.',
        },
        'At least at the end of every session you work on the project',

        'Commit your changes to record them as part of your project history': 'This is a necessary step before pushing your changes to GitHub.',
        'Add a hash to your commit to identify it easily': 'The HASH code is automatically generated by Git each time you create a commit. It allows you to unambiguously identify  the commit.',
        },
