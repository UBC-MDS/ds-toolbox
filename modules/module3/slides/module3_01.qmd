:::{.notes}
Data analysis projects often require iteration and revision 
to move from an initial idea to a finished product ready for the intended audience.
Without deliberate and conscious effort towards tracking changes made to the analysis,
projects tend to become messy. 
  
This mess can have serious, negative repercussions on an analysis project,
including losing interesting results files that your code cannot reproduce, 
temporary files with snippets of ideas that are forgotten or not easy to find,
mind-boggling file names that make it unclear which is the current working version of the file 
(e.g., `document_final.txt`, `to_hand_in_final_v2.txt`, etc.), and more.

Being able to record and view the history of a data analysis project is important
for understanding how and why decisions to use one method or another were made,
among other things.

What does exactly mean to "record the history of a project"?

Instead of creating a new copy for each version of a file
with an unwieldy name (as in the image), 
version control allows you to have a single file
and records the changes between the versions.

Many of you might already have used version control software
if you work with Google Docs, Dropbox, or TimeMachine on macOS. 
These programs, all automatically create versions of your documents
and you can then browse through the history.

Additionally, data analyses are typically completed by teams.
This means that files need to be shared across multiple computers,
and multiple people often end up editing the project simultaneously.
In such a situation,
determining who has the latest version of the project
and how to resolve conflicting edits—can be a real challenge.

Version control also facilitates collaboration via tools
to share edits with others and resolve conflicting edits.
But even if you’re working on a project alone,
you should still use version control.
It helps you keep track of what you’ve done,
when you did it, and what you’re planning to do next!

:::{.notes}
To **version control** a project, you generally need two things:
(1) a version control system and
(2) a repository hosting service.

The version control system is
the software responsible for tracking changes,
sharing changes you make with others,
obtaining changes from others,
and resolving conflicting edits.
  
The repository hosting service is responsible for storing
a copy of the version-controlled project online (a repository),
where you and your collaborators can access it remotely,
discuss issues and bugs, and distribute your final product.
For both of these items,
there is a wide variety of choices.

In this course, we’ll use Git for version control,
and GitHub for repository hosting,
because both are currently the most widely used platforms.

## When should you use a repository hosting service?

:::{.notes} 
Technically you don’t have to use a repository hosting service.
You can, for example,
version control a project that is stored only in a folder on your computer—
never sharing it on a repository hosting service.
  
But using a repository hosting service
provides a few big benefits,
including managing collaborator access permissions,
tools to discuss and track bugs,
and the ability to have external collaborators contribute work,
not to mention the safety of having your work backed up in the cloud.
  
Since most repository hosting services now offer free accounts,
there are not many situations
in which you wouldn't want to use one for your project.
