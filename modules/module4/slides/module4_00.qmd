## Module Learning Outcomes

In this module you will learn how to

1. Explore the Git history via `git log` in the terminal, and the equivalent functions in JupyterLab and GitHub.
2. Compare commits using `git diff` in the terminal, and the equivalent functions in JupyterLab and GitHub.
3. Solve merge conflicts at the command line and in VS Code.
4. Avoid pushing certain local files by including a `.gitignore` file.
5. Differentiate between doing a revert and a hard reset of a commit when restoring an older version of a project.
